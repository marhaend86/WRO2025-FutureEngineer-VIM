## Our Team
>Member
- **Valensia Wahyu Pamungkas** from SMK Pawyatan Daha 3 Kediri
- **Ilham Khefi Ramadhanu** from Universitas Nusantara PGRI Kediri
- **Mahendra** from Institut Teknologi Al Makrusiyah Lirboyo Kota Kediri


Team VIM is an ambitious group of high school and university students who aspire to become leaders in the field of autonomous vehicles. By taking the initiative to participate in the WRO Future Engineers challenge, we aim to deepen our experience in engineering, programming, and problem-solving.
- Expand our knowledge in the field of autonomous vehicles
- Learn and apply best practices in software development and organization (e.g., using GitHub)
- Strengthen our proficiency in working with electronic components and hardware integration
- Develop teamwork, coordination, and creative problem-solving skills to address complex engineering challenges with innovation

We believe that by working together as Team VIM, we can turn our passion into meaningful results and contribute to the exciting future of autonomous vehicle technology.

## Electrical Components
Our chassis is controlled by the Arduino Mega 2560 Pro microcontroller, which gathers data from various sensors and uses this information to control the motors through an Ichibot motor driver board. The sensors we are currently using on our vehicle include:
- Pixycam 2.1
- Grove Ultrasonic Sensor

We use the Pixycam 2.1 to identify the locations of obstacles and effectively avoid them. An ultrasonic sensor is used to track and maintain a safe distance from the wall, ensuring the vehicle follows the intended path smoothly.
More information about our robotâ€™s electrical components, wiring, and integration can be found in the README file located in the electrical folder of our repository.
